Place the takoyaki.glb 3D model in this directory.

For the best appearance, create a 3D model with:
1. The takoyaki ball with textured surface
2. Some sauce/toppings visible on top
3. A small wooden pick sticking out
4. Optional tentacle pieces visible inside

The model should be centered at origin with approximately 1 unit diameter.
